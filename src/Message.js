      <h2>Happy Anniversary my bb kitty :)</h2>
      <p>
        Bello bb, we are 3!
        <br />
		I am deeply grateful for the love and care you provided me for these 3 years. Without you,
		I don't think I would be able to survive this harsh adulting period. This relationship has
		helped me to grow into a better person, especially for those times that I have hurt
		you. Yet, you still forgive me, I am sincerely apologetic. I have regretted my actions and
		I promise I won't hurt you again. As we embraced through tough times together, there were
		happy moments with you, such as messing around with tako & bobby and, travelling. I hope that 
		our efforts will not be wasted as we embark into the next chapter of our lives, staying together.
		bb kitty, I am sorry and appreciative of you, understanding me as a person and fulfilling my needs.
		I know it is not easy. So, thank you and I will work harder to provide a better life for you :) Happy 3 years of being 
		together, I love you &lt;3 You will always be my white bb kitty! 
		<br />
		Yours truly, grey kitty.
